# discord-lyrics
This is just for a silly project I have to make the Conan Gray lyric videos of [Disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGZa-l96FmQ) and [Best Friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMHkWgOE6X8), but in Discord.
This is for fun, and for trying out the Python requests module a bit.

no sue pls.
